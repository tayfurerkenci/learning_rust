# Learning Rust

This repository contains my small projects as I learn Rust.

## Projects

1. `hello_cargo`: A simple program that prints "Hello, world!".
2. `guessing_game`: A simple program that will generate a random integer between 1 and 100. It will then prompt the player to enter a guess. After a guess is entered, the program will indicate whether the guess is too low or too high. If the guess is correct, the game will print a congratulatory message and exit.".

## Running the projects

Each project is a separate Rust executable. Navigate into the project's directory and use `cargo run` to run it.
